In addition to this, we may also use this data for administrative and internal purposes, such as website management and system maintenance.</p>
                                <p>To support the smooth functioning of our services, we may also engage third-party providers who specialize in services such as identity management, website hosting, data analysis, data backup, security, and storage. These providers are carefully selected based on their ability to provide high-quality services and ensure the security and protection of personal data.</p>
                                <p>We have strict standards for the third-party providers we work with, which include requirements for maintaining high levels of security and confidentiality in handling personal data. These providers are required to process personal data only as instructed by us and to ensure that their own sub-processors also meet our security and confidentiality standards. By setting these high expectations for our third-party providers, we strive to ensure that personal data is handled responsibly and with the utmost care throughout its lifecycle.</p>
                                <p>Overall, our commitment is to ensure that any personal data we handle is kept safe and secure, and is only used for legitimate purposes that are clearly communicated to the individuals concerned.</p>
